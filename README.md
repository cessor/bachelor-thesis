Source Code

The Source Code for the tools I used to generate the data for my thesis can be found here:

[Empathic Code - Overview](https://github.com/empathic-code)

 - [Data Acquisition Client "Peter"](https://github.com/empathic-code/weasel-keeper): The web application I used to obtain the data for my study
 - [Antwort DSL](https://github.com/empathic-code/antwort): A DSL I used to prototype my HTML Questionnaires
 - [Weasel Keeper](https://github.com/empathic-code/weasel-keeper): The Roslyn based CLI tool I used to create the stimulus material for my study. It mangles the identifiers of C#-Source code to abbreviations or single letters.
